I currently don't have an osx machine so I don't have time to maintain this. Would highly recommend using this fork (https://github.com/area/osx-wiiu-gcc-adapter) instead which appears to be superior in every way anyways.

How to use:

1. Make sure you have xcode installed. You can get it for free via the app store.

2. click the "Download Zip" link on the lower right side of this page.

3. Open the unzipped folder and double click on "wiiu-gcc-adapter.xcodeproj"

4. Ensure that xcode opens (if not you don't have xcode installed, but then again if you don't have xcode installed you aren't following these steps so you aren't reading this anyways. who am I talking to then....)

5. Ensure that your adapter is plugged in. Unless using a wavebird you only need to plug in the black usb. I haven't tested wavebirds but afaik they should work, no promises though.

6. Click the Play button at the top left corner of the xcode window.

7. Use your controller. The 4 ports should show up in the dolphin Devices list as "WiiU GCC Port #"

The program will terminate if the Adapter is unplugged. So anytime you unplug and want to start playing again just go back to the xcode window and hit the triangle again.

Let me know if you have any problems, have a maylay day and may fox be with you all =D
